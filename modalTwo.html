        <p style="font-size:14pt;"> The binary understanding of gender is visible in all aspects of technology. There is a prevalence in not only software, but also hardware too. </p>
        <p style="font-size:14pt;"> Through Voice User Interfaces (VUIs) we can see how the role of the subservient woman persists through digital means. AI-powered voice assistants, such as Alexa (Amazon), Siri (Apple), and Google Assistant (Google) all default to using feminine voices. These operating systems hold no power of agency beyond what the user requests. </p>
        <p style="font-size:14pt;"> Connectors and fasteners have also fallen victim to the ‘genderfication’ of innate objects found in technology. A “male” connector has a solid pin in the center conductor and a “female” connector has a center conductor with a hole to accept the pin. This analogy between inanimate objects and humans serves to show how technology cannot physically escape gendered characterization and emphasizes the lack of neutral terminology in regards to technology.</p>
        <p style="font-size:14pt;"> Facial recognition technologies often have a higher false match rate and a higher false non- match rate for women. Additionally, it’s important to note that facial recognition systems are infamous for misidentifying those with darker skin tones. This designates this problem as an expansive issue, and also shows the intersection with other international marginalized communities.</p>
        <p style="font-size:14pt;"> One of the most pervasive myths about technology is that it is portrayed as an unbiased entity. However, technologies reflect not only the biases in their own data collection, but also the biases of people who created them</p>
        <p style="font-size:14pt;"> Both technology and gender are products of the human mind. Through the bias found in technology, the problem of the heterosexual matrix is exacerbated; effectively continuing the ‘othering’ of those who do not fit into the binary understanding of gender.</p>
